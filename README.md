# On-the-Galois-groups-of-Generalized-Fibonacci-polynomials
In this study, we investigate the Galois groups of Fibonacci and Lucas polynomials over both
the rational field and the rational function field. Using computational experiments performed with
MAGMA, we examine the structure of the Galois groups of generalized Fibonacci-like polynomials.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the roots of these generalized Fibonacci-like polynomials are
not constructible using a ruler and compass
